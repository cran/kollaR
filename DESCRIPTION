Description: Functions for analysing eye tracking data, including event detection, visualizations and area of interest (AOI) based analyses. 
  The package includes implementations of the IV-T, I-DT, adaptive velocity threshold, and Identification by two means clustering (I2MC) algorithms.
  See separate documentation for each function. The principles underlying I-VT and I-DT algorithms are described in   Salvucci & Goldberg (2000,\doi{10.1145/355017.355028}). 
  Two-means clustering is described in Hessels et al. (2017, \doi{10.3758/s13428-016-0822-1}). 
  The adaptive velocity threshold algorithm is described in Nystr√∂m & Holmqvist (2010,\doi{10.3758/BRM.42.1.188}).
